<p>I am happy to assist you in the design of your API. I'm a big fan of simple, pragmatic API design, and willing to share my experience with you. If its an existing, or a brand new API I'm happy to be of service.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I can just add an extra layer of awarness to your team, and maybe thinking of a few things that you may not have, saving you some headache down the road. There are many existing patterns available out there to consider when it comes to designing your API -- let me know if I can help you find them.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I am what you are needing, but I'm happy to explore the possibilities with you. If I can't help you, maybe one of my network of partners can help--so head over <a href="http://apievangelist.com/contact/">to my contact page, and choose the channel</a> that works for you, and drop me a line.</p>
<p>Also make sure you take look at <a href="http://apievangelist.com/services/">my wider list of API services that I offer</a>, to see if there is something else I can help you with along the way.</p>
